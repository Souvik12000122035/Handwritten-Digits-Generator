# Handwritten-Digits-Generator

This project demonstrates how to generate synthetic handwritten digit images using deep learning techniques. Using the popular MNIST dataset as training input, the model learns to produce realistic handwritten digits that resemble human writing.

Dataset -
MNIST Handwritten Digits [ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv ]

Technologies Used : 
Python,  TensorFlow / Keras,  NumPy,  Matplotlib,  Jupyter Notebook

Features
1. Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset

2. Builds a deep neural network to generate images

3. Trains the model on digit images

4. Visualizes generated images during training
